    excerpt: "This week we're highlighting Brené Brown's powerful talk on vulnerability and its role in courage, authenticity, and connection.",
    content: `
      <p>This week, we want to shine a spotlight on one of the most impactful TED Talks of all time: "The Power of Vulnerability" by Brené Brown. With over 60 million views, this talk has touched hearts and changed perspectives around the world.</p>
      
      <p>Brown's research on shame, vulnerability, and leadership has profound implications for how we connect with others and lead meaningful lives. Her key insight? Vulnerability isn't weakness; it's our most accurate measure of courage.</p>
      
      <h3>Key Takeaways:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Vulnerability is the birthplace of innovation, creativity, and change</li>
        <li>We cannot selectively numb emotions - when we numb difficult feelings, we also numb joy and happiness</li>
        <li>Shame needs three things to grow: secrecy, silence, and judgment</li>
        <li>Empathy fuels connection while sympathy drives disconnection</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>As we prepare for TEDxIIMT, we're reminded of why these conversations matter. Ideas that challenge us, make us uncomfortable, and push us to grow are exactly the kind of "ideas worth spreading" that TED was founded on.</p>

    content: `
      <p>The magic of a TEDx event doesn't happen overnight. Over the past few months, our dedicated team of volunteers has been working around the clock to bring you an experience that will inspire, challenge, and connect our community.</p>
      
      <h3>What Goes Into Planning TEDxIIMT?</h3>
      
      <p><strong>Speaker Curation:</strong> Our speaker selection committee has reviewed over 200 applications and nominations. We're looking for speakers who don't just share information, but transform perspectives.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Venue Design:</strong> Every detail matters, from the iconic red circle on stage to the audience seating arrangement. We're creating an intimate space that fosters deep listening and connection.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Community Building:</strong> This isn't just about the day of the event. We're building a community of curious minds who will continue these conversations long after the last speaker leaves the stage.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Student Involvement:</strong> What makes TEDxIIMT special is our commitment to student voices. Over 50 students are involved in various aspects of production, from event management to social media storytelling.</p>
      
      <p>The energy in our planning meetings is infectious. Everyone brings unique skills and perspectives, and watching this vision come together has been incredibly rewarding.</p>

    category: "Ideas & Innovation",
    excerpt: "Exploring the fascinating research behind how ideas spread through communities and why some ideas stick while others fade away.",
    content: `
      <p>Have you ever wondered why some ideas catch fire while others fizzle out? As we prepare for TEDxIIMT, we've been diving deep into the science behind viral ideas and meaningful change.</p>
      
      <p>Malcolm Gladwell's "The Tipping Point" introduced many of us to the concept of how small changes can make a big difference. But recent research has revealed even more fascinating insights about how ideas spread.</p>
      
      <h3>What Makes Ideas Stick?</h3>
      
      <p><strong>Emotional Resonance:</strong> Ideas that evoke strong emotions - whether joy, anger, or inspiration - are more likely to be shared and remembered.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Social Currency:</strong> We share ideas that make us look good or help us connect with others who share our values.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Practical Value:</strong> Ideas that help people solve problems or improve their lives have natural staying power.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Stories Over Statistics:</strong> Our brains are wired for narrative. A compelling story will always beat a list of facts.</p>
      
      <p>This research shapes everything we do at TEDxIIMT. From speaker selection to event design, we're creating conditions for ideas to not just be heard, but to truly spread and create lasting impact.</p>
      
      <p>What idea has changed your life? We'd love to hear your story as we prepare to share new ones at our event.</p>
